## About

This project is a compiler for a subset of the C programming language, implemented in Rust. It is designed to parse, analyze, and generate machine code for a simplified version of C, focusing on core language features such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. This project is an exploration of compiler theory and low-level programming concepts, with the goal of building a working C-like compiler from scratch.

The development of this compiler has been greatly aided by the book [Building a C Compiler](https://nostarch.com/writing-c-compiler) by [Nora Sandler](https://norasandler.com/), which served as both a guide and inspiration throughout the process. By following its principles and adding my own implementation in Rust, this project demonstrates how traditional compiler concepts can be translated to modern systems programming languages.

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, or suggest improvements!
