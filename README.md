## Overview

The Sinners C programming language is very closely related to the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) which means it is a low level procedural systems programming language with a static type system and manual memory management. The diffrences to C mainly manifest in the naming of keywords which are themed around Satanic/Demonic vocabulary. In contrast to Holy C, Sinners C compiles to an executable that runs natively on x86 architectures

## Tooling

- For a better development experience, Sinners-C supports the [Heaven's Door](https://github.com/Turtel216/Heavens-Door) editor, which provides syntax highlighting specifically for the language.
